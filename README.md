# AI BASED CODE GENERATOR
**An NLP Transformer model that generates Python code upon providing Natural Language as an input.**

## What is a Transformer Model?
The Transformer can be understood in terms of its three components:
1. An Encoder that encodes an input sequence into state representation vectors.
2. An Attention mechanism that enables our Transformer model to focus on the right aspects of 
the sequential input stream. This is used repeatedly within both the encoder and the decoder 
to help them contextualize the input data. Attention is a mechanism that allows a model to 
focus on the necessary parts of the input sequence as per the demands of the task at hand
3. A Decoder that decodes the state representation vector to generate the target output sequence.
